# MVC-Tech-Blog

## Description

As a true full-stack web developer, it's important that I'm able to understand the material I'm learning and share these cool tips and tricks with other developers that are also looking to learn and grow. I must be able to show that I know how to handle both the front-end and back-end environments and enable them to pass information back and forth. I created a simple tech blog to allow other users to communicate with one another and share their knowledge. 

## Installation

You can find the tech blog on Heroku at the link below:

## Usage

Without logging in, you'll be able to see all posts from all users immediately on the Homepage. When you click on a post's title, you'll be able to see it and its comments. To do anything else on the blog, you'll need to create an account by clicking Login in the navigation bar. 

If you're a new user, fill out the Signup form on the right to create an account. Otherwise, fill out the Login form on the left to login.

Once you're logged in, you'll have full access to the site. On the Homepage, when you click on any post's title, you'll see not just the post and its comments but you'll also be able to add your own comment.

When you click on the Dashboard, you'll be able to see all posts you've made on the right. To create a new post, fill out the Write a New Post form on the left and click Submit. You'll see the new post on the right. To delete one of your posts, click the Delete button to delete it and all comments on it. To update one of your posts, click on the Update button, and you'll see its title and content appear in the Update an Existing Post form below the New Post form. Make your changes in those fields and click on the Update button below to update your post.
